# Laravel + TypeScript + React + Tailwind + Twin

This starter shows how to use Tailwind with a React frontend and a Laravel backend.
TypeScript is used for type checking and Babel is used for compiling. This improves the [compilation speed](https://iamturns.com/typescript-babel/) and works perfectly with [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro).

## Getting started

1. Install composer: `composer install`
2. Install npm packages: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `php artisan serve`
4. Start the webpack dev server: `npm run hot`

## Notes

- The React app sits in: `resources/js`
- Run `tsc` to check for TypeScript errors
